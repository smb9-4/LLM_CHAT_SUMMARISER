## Features

- **Contextual Continuation Packs:** Combines the core topic, filtered user requests, and recent assistant explanations into a single clipboard pack designed to bring other ChatGPT sessions or models up to speed instantly.
- **Raw Chat Extraction:** One-click backup of the entire text thread, properly mapping roles (`USER` vs `ASSISTANT`).
- **Sleek Interface:** An ultra-clean, terminal-inspired dark grid footprint optimized for zero layout shift.
- **Privacy First:** 100% execution happens locally via the Chrome Scripting API. Your conversation data never leaves your machine.
